                          The Gateway of India is a famous monument located in Mumbai, Maharashtra.<br>
                          It was built during the British rule in 1924.<br>
                          The structure overlooks the Arabian Sea at Apollo Bunder.<br>
                          It was designed by architect George Wittet in Indo-Saracenic style.<br>
                          The monument was built to commemorate the visit of King George V and Queen Mary to India in 1911.<br>
                          It is made of yellow basalt and reinforced concrete.<br>
                          The central arch is 26 meters (85 feet) high.<br>
                          The Gateway was the ceremonial entrance for Viceroys and Governors to India.<br>
                          In 1948, the last British troops departed India through this gateway.<br>
                          Today, it is a popular tourist spot and a symbol of Mumbai.</p>
