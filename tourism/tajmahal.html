                          The Taj Mahal is a famous monument located in Agra, India.<br>
                          It was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal.<br>
                          Construction began in 1632 and was completed around 1648, with surrounding structures finishing in 1653.<br>
                          The monument is made of white marble that changes shades with sunlight and moonlight.<br>
                          It is one of the finest examples of Mughal architecture, blending Persian, Islamic, and Indian styles.<br>
                          The Taj Mahal is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the New Seven Wonders of the World.<br>
                          It is surrounded by beautiful gardens, fountains, and a reflecting pool.<br>
                          The central dome is about 73 meters (240 feet) high and is flanked by four minarets.<br>
                          Millions of tourists from all over the world visit the Taj Mahal each year.<br>
                          It symbolizes eternal love and is often called a “teardrop on the cheek of time.”</p>
