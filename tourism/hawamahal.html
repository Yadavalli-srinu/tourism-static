                          The Hawa Mahal is a famous palace located in Jaipur, Rajasthan.<br>
                          It was built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh.<br>
                          The architect of the palace was Lal Chand Ustad.<br>
                          Its name means “Palace of Winds” or “Palace of Breeze.”<br>
                          The structure is made of red and pink sandstone.<br>
                          It has 953 small windows called jharokhas, decorated with intricate latticework.<br>
                          The design allowed royal women to watch street processions without being seen.<br>
                          It is shaped like the crown of Lord Krishna.<br>
                          The Hawa Mahal is a five-story building with no front entrance from the outside; entry is from the back.<br>
                          It is one of Jaipur’s most popular tourist attractions and an iconic landmark of Rajasthan.</p>
