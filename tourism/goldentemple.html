                          The Golden Temple, also known as Sri Harmandir Sahib, is located in Amritsar, Punjab.<br>
                          It is the holiest shrine in Sikhism.<br>
                          The temple was founded by Guru Ram Das in 1581 and completed by Guru Arjan Dev in 1604.<br>
                          Its upper floors are covered with gold, giving it the name “Golden Temple.”<br>
                          The temple is surrounded by a sacred water tank called the Amrit Sarovar.<br>
                          The Guru Granth Sahib, the holy book of Sikhs, is kept inside the temple.<br>
                          It is open to people of all religions and backgrounds.<br>
                          The temple complex also houses the world’s largest free kitchen (langar), serving thousands daily.<br>
                          The architecture blends Islamic, Hindu, and Rajput styles.<br>
                          It is a major pilgrimage site and a symbol of peace, equality, and spiritual devotion.</p>
