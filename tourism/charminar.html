                          The Charminar is a historic monument located in Hyderabad, India.<br>
                          It was built in 1591 by Sultan Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah.<br>
                          The name “Charminar” means “Four Minarets” in Hindi and Urdu.<br>
                          It was constructed to commemorate the end of a deadly plague in the city.<br>
                          The structure is made of granite, limestone, and mortar.<br>
                          Each minaret is about 56 meters (184 feet) high.<br>
                          The monument has four grand arches facing four different directions.<br>
                          It is a blend of Indo-Islamic architecture with Persian influences.<br>
                          The Charminar is surrounded by a bustling market called Laad Bazaar, famous for bangles.<br>
                          It is one of the most popular tourist attractions and a symbol of Hyderabad.</p>
